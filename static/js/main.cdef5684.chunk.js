But it was worth it."},{id:2,question:"There's a little mistake in thr graphic design portfolio. I'm sure it passed by you :P I'll send a picture",answer:"Meine notice kiya tha, but there wasn't much I could do about it. I had to use the same spacing for other heading on their respective pages as well. So I just ignored it and let it be the way it was."},{id:3,question:"The architectural renders on the home page. They were not in the portfolio page of Architecture.",answer:"Yes true. This is my mistake. So all praise to you for still noticing it. I used those images when I was designing it. So they were in the initial development of the website. But when we started adding data for the website, I missed it and then it was too late for me to update it. Moreover, all of the content on Architectural Visualisation part, is designed in a specific way. Wo part homepage pay adjust nae hona tha. And I was too tired to add Architecutural Visualisation (in Homepage) content in Portfolio Page of it. "},{id:4,question:"The cards on the mobile development portfolio page were really good. I liked those a little better than the one on the homepage.",answer:"To be honest, this was such a good observation. I didn't notice it till now that they are different than the one on the homepage. But I guess it works perfect on their respective pages. In Mobile Dev Portfolio Page, I didn't want to use those same animations again. I think it could've felt repeated so I just went with the simple layout like the Website Section on HomePage."},{id:5,question:"You didn't add heading 'Portfolio' on the main portfolio page. So it looks a little lost. Bechara xD",answer:"Cool observation. Many people were doubtful about this page. And a lot of people had their reservations on this page. Only people who knew about the functioning of this page, know what to do with it. Most people were confused with it. So this is a must redesign."},{id:6,question:"The cards on the main portfolio page. You designed the whole website so beautifully. It feels jesay you designed this page at the last :P",answer:"True. I personally had a lot of issues to manage the user journey for this website. There aren't many this thoughtful software companies websites that I could look into. So yes, I kinda wasnt't focused on it. Plus I don't have a lot of people from whom I could discuss it. So yes, this page sucks. I guess I added icons on last 3/4 days, just to make it look lively than previously simple buttons."}],oe=[{id:1,question:"REAL COOL COPY",answer:"REAL COOL COPY OF WHAT?"},{id:2,question:"You developed the company marketing approach right? It shows cause you like Apple and I can see the inspiration.",answer:"Yes. I really wanted to put my special attention to this page. I have a personal attachment to my company and what we do against all the odds. Usually software engineers have secured jobs and like crazy salaries. I am not saying that we aren't earning good, but I am just saying that we aren't taken seriously since we don't have fancy events, perks and shashkay as most of our classmates say they enjoy in their respective companies and we aren't taken seriously so I really wanted to put out a statement by designing this page. Like it's declaring a war and I feel like a solider. Like anybody want war? I am excited to start. Get indicted tomorrow and I will be out by the morn, before I even yawn. Like stay in your lane, I remind these lil' boyses. This is a victory lane, now do I need a horn?."},{id:3,question:"Acha. I loved this page a lot. Usually companies don't have put this much attention on the team. Although it helps to build team morale.",answer:"Yes. I guess my previous answer says the same thing about this question as well."},{id:4,question:"There's a little issue of negative space in the value cards. Again. I think this accidentally passed by you so yeah.",answer:"I don't think so. I do believe that they are very close to each other can be have some more vertical spacing between them. Can be a good fix. If you visit the website version, you will see Ali Nasir's card on the left with nothing on right. Through code, I could've stretch it to the right side as well, but that could've been such a weird feeling in website verison. You missed it so I thought it's good to mention :P "},{id:5,question:"Loved the Pakistan map. The simple outline. And your location. There were two things. First, Lahore kesi aur font main lekha hai xD Second, I don't like the Pakistan lekha howa at the back. It destroys the focus on the map. Please remove it xD. Just write -Lahore, Pakistan- Samajh jayenge.",answer:"Thank you for the map thing. I wanted to show from where we belong. We don't have a fancy office location and people usually showcase their address in their contact page. Humara address koi acha nae hai tou I thought it would be good to come up with something creative. Adding Pakistan in the background was just an attempt to make it fill with something while keeping the minimalist look and feel. I used outlines for the map since that was the best thing to do. Moreover, since you know kay Pakistan ka map aisa hai, we have to deal with clients from all over the world, so I think it was a good idea to add Paksitan, in the background. Moreover, adding Lahore Pakistan wasn't looking nice. Visually speaking. The font is surely different. It's google personal font. I initially planned to use Google's personal font, but it's not allowed to use commerically so I used it in a picture, escaping the algorithm to catch it. xD And the font name is Product Sans - by Google."}],ce=[{id:1,question:" Acha. In the beginning, you have the heading 'Meet Sinecure' Then 'You dream work. Our team work.' Then the body text. On desktop, the body text and the tag line has the same px, right? The tag line is just bold. On mobile, that's not the case. The body text is smaller than the tag line. And then the tag line is smaller than the title. So it has a lot of variations. And sahi contrast nae ho raha. I hope you got what I meant?",answer:"Yes, I understand your concerns over it. Like I said earlier, it's easier to read stuff on the web, but on the mobile, you have to be careful. I was comfortable enough to keep the same font sizes for the tag-line and the body text, but if I was keeping tagline and body text same on the mobile, then due green color surrounding tagline was visually making the text feel small. Since it was our tagline, most people will read it and will scroll over the body text. In the mobile version, the body text is taking a lot of screen so I had to reduce it's size since no one is going to read all of that text, but I wanted them to read out tagline. I hope I able to make you understand what I mean."},{id:2,question:"Pakistan nazar he nae aa raha. Bht ghoor se dekhna parhta. Remove kar de'n ussay xD",answer:"Haha, I guess with my arguments before, I was able to make a point. If it's trouble noticing it on the phone, I can create another image, which a slighter more visible Pakistan in the background for the mobile version alone. It will stay the same on the web."},{id:3,question:"My personal observation",answer:"The page title of About is 'Sinecure | Contact', instead of 'Sinecure | About'. Big mistake!!! "}],re=[{id:1,question:"Career wala section is perfect. Bus I have a question. The title and the secondary text. They are of the same size. Thori variation nae honi chaheye thi?",answer:"Thank you so much. Yes I agree with you on this. We never discussed about adding an open vacany on the website. I just thought of it in last 40 minutes I guess and copy pasted texts from different UI/UX Designers job description and made it a part of the website. Nothing thoughtful.
